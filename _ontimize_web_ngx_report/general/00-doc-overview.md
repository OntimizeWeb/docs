## Introduction

The module **Ontimize Web Report**  is a set of reporting tools for web applications based in [OntimizeWeb](https://github.com/OntimizeWeb/ontimize-web-ngx){:target="_blank"}.

**Ontimize Web Report** implements reporting with:

* Reports **stored**
The pre-generated reports in jasper templates can be generated from anywhere in the application, for this you have to follow a series of steps listed in this [link]({{ base_path }}/report/components/report/overview)

* Report **on-demand**
Allow the final users of the applications developed with Ontimize to define, view and store reports from any table available in the application.
This visual tool will allow users to define parameters of the report such as **title, subtitle, columns to display, differents styles options, sorting, grouping and data aggregate functions** of the report. With these parameters and the data of the table, this component will dynamically generate the report and present it to the user. In addition, all these settings will can be stored in a system of preferences.
