The target of this section is first contact with Ontimize Web applications, so we will start with a sample application called '*QuickStart*'.


'*QuickStart'* is a simple app which manages the data of a Bank: managing of customers, their accounts and their transactions. No separate database is required - all data is stored in a REST cloud service.

The QuickStart application is a good test bench where you can explore the structure and the different definition files of the application, how to define the navigation between screens, or see a small sample of the set of fields that Ontimize Web has.

Run the live example.
