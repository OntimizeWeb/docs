## Overview

In this section we are going to show you how to perform some more advanced changes to the QuickStart app code.



## Create a new module.

This section explains how to add a new module for managing the employees of the Bank. You can find all
information [here]({{ base_path }}/getting-started/adv-changes-new-module/).

## Add a table form.

In this section we will explain how to create the initial form where a full list of employees is shown.
You can find all information [here]({{ base_path }}/getting-started/adv-changes-table-form/).

## Employee details form.

Once you have the full list of employees, the next logical step is to access the detail data of a determined employee. In this section you will configure the details form to do it. You can find all information [here]({{ base_path }}/getting-started/adv-changes-drill-down/).

## Override default logic.

Sometimes default behaviour of form is not sufficient for the requirements. It is therefore possible
to override the default logic of the *o-form* component.
You can find how to do it [here]({{ base_path }}/getting-started/adv-changes-override/).
