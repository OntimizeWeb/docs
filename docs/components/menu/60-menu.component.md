Ontimize Web provides three components designed to add menu with the content.
* **App layout**: allows to build a side navigator for application. You can read more about the component [here]({{ base_path }}/components/applayout/overview)

* **Bar menu**: builds automatically in navigation header for application. You can read more about the component [here]({{ base_path }}/components/barmenu/overview)

* **Card menu layout**: builds automatically a dashboard page. You can read more about the component [here]({{ base_path }}/components/cardmenulayout/overview)

The three components are building using the [application menu configuration]({{ base_path }}/guide/appconfig/#menu-configuration){:target="_blank"} and you can also include your own menu without using the application menu configuration.
