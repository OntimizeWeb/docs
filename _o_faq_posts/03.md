body: "
All the OntimizeWeb components that use services for retrieving data have the attributes <i>query-method</i>, <i>paginated-query-method</i>, <i>insert-method</i>, <i>update-method</i> and <i>deleted-method</i>. The purpose of these attributes is allowing the component to use your own CRUD methods defined in your service. With this you can define, for example, as many query methods as you want.
