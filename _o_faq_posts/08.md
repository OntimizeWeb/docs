body: "
An Angular Application Environment is JSON configuration information that tells the build system which files to change when you use ng build and ng serve.<br/>
You can also create variables with different values in each of the environment files.<br/>
Check the <a href='https://angular.io/guide/build' target='blank'>official documentation</a> to understand more about the environment configuration.
