title: "How to use query-on-event?"
body: "
<code>query-on-event</code> is an input of the <i>OServiceBaseComponent</i>. This input will reference to an event of the component that must listen to in order to perform its query. The component will wait until the event you choose is fired to perform the request of the data. 
For example: query-on-event="componentAttr.onValueChange". This will perform the query when the value of the component changes.
You can check how to use it <a href='../components/input/overviewservice/overview'>here</a> and a example of dependant combos <a href='https://try.imatia.com/ontimizeweb/v8/playground/main/inputs/combo'>here</a>.
