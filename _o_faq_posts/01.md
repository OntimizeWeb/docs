There is a strict standard limit for the memory usage in V8 of around 1.7 GB, if you do not increase it manually.<br/>
To increase this limit you have to use this flag on building or serving the application:<br/>
<code>--max_old_space_size=8048</code><br/>
Example: <code>npm run production-aot --max_old_space_size=8048</code>
