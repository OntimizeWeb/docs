# Overview

The '*o-form*' component is a special component that allows you to handle a large amount of data and perform operations on data such as creation, deletion, updating and querying.

This component makes data management easier and allows the developer to focus on the screen and application logic.

The data representation is performed via input fields (such as text, checkbox and combo boxes), lists, or tables.

You can find further information about '*o-form*' configuration parameters in the [Components]({{ base_path }}/components/form/){:target="_blank"} section.

## Form life hooks

The '*o-form*' component has different life cycles depending on the value of the ‘editable-detail’ parameter, you can see how it works [here]({{ base_path }}/form/life-hooks/)
