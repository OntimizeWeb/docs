The target of this section is to set first contact with Ontimize Web applications, so we will start from a sample application called QuickStart.

Quickstart is a simple app which manages the data of a Bank, allowing the management of customers, theirs accounts and their transaction movements. We do not have to take care about data
due to all managed data into the app are provided by a REST service that is connected with a server data in the cloud.

The quickstart application is a good test bench in which you can see the structure and the different definition files of the application, how to define
the navigation between screens or see a small sample of the set of fields that Ontimize Web has among other things.

Run the [live example](https://ontimizeweb.github.io/ontimize-web-ng2-quickstart).
