Having trouble working with the framework? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/ontimizeweb/ontimize-web-ngx/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/ontimizeweb/ontimize-web-ngx/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.
