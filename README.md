## Local deployment

To deploy the documentation on your local machine first you need to do it is to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target='_blank'} running the `gem install jekyll bundler` command.

Once you have Jekyll installed correctly you need to install de gems with the following command `bundle install`.

And finally all you need to do whenever you want to **deploy** the documentation on developer mode it is to execute this command: `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml`.
